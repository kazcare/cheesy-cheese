        <h2>Why is cheese so amaaaaazing!</h2>
        <p>
            Why is cheese so amazing?
            What makes cheese taste so good?
            It's simple, Tunick said:
            "It's because the bacteria break down the proteins
            and especially the fats into a whole quite a large number of molecules that have flavors."

            It may not exactly be a dirty little secret, but it’s certainly dirty.
            Cheese – that sultry dairy product that we positively obsess over –
            is nothing but decay and decomposition. Literally.
            It’s the product of bacteria digesting milk sugar (lactose)
            until the coagulated milk is cut into those sweet,
            sweet (or bitter or stinky or salty) curds.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet, we love it so. My God, we long for it.
            Cheese is the ooey-gooey, melty stuff that dreams are made of.
            It’s why we break diets, grill bread, eat macaroni, and, heck, wake up in the morning.
            It’s so freaking happiness-inducing that
            it’s the word we’ve chosen to make people smile when photographing them.

            In honor of National Cheese Lover’s Day on Jan. 20, we went to the pros –
            the people who get intimate with it on a daily basis, the big cheeses, so to speak –
            to answer the rich, velvety, tangy question: Why do we love cheese so much?
        </p>
        <p>
            “I think the combination of fat, its creaminess,
            salt and the tang produced by the cultures just make it a
            combination that speaks to all the sensory locations of the tongue and mouth,”
            said Birgit Halbreiter, microbiologist and co-owner of Fort Collins-based MouCo
            Cheese Company.
