## Features

### Header/Nav Bar

    Website is having a static header element with logo on the left side of the desktop page.

    Navigation bar elements are increase in size when the particular navbar element is hovered, plus the nav link is underlined for the current active page.
    These properties and looks of the header and navbar are consistant throughout the website.

    Nav bar hanging against the logo on the right hand side, but it chages its position for smaller screen sizes. It normally looks like the following
    
    But navigation links move under the logo for screen sizes 950px and smaller (for tablets)

    It further changes its position for screen sizes 800px and smaller (for smart phones/ tablets in portrait mode)

    All pages of the website has a hero image underneath the header and navbar area with cover text on it saying what is the website about, which changes its position on screen smaller than 950px.

    Navigation links change its size as mouse pointer hovers over these and current page link stays underlined.

    The logo, nav bar and hero image on the top and footer at the bottom is consistent to all the pages. Content changes between those areas. 

### Landing Page

    On home page, under the hero image has some text including some facts about cheese and why people think it is amazing, what actually cheese is and what is the origin of cheese? It has an picture on the right hand side of the text, which takes over 100% of the width when screen size is reduced to 800 pixels or less.

### Recipe Pages
    There are currently 2 recipe pages available, Mac n Cheese and Cheesy Pizza.
    These recipe pages have same header and footer layout, instead of body text these have list on ingredients and procedure of cooking the specific food.

    Lay out of the recipe pages are similar to each other. Both has Ingredients and Method of cooking the dish with a image of the cooked dish beside it. It is responsive to smaller screen sizes same as the home page.

### Footer

    Footer contains social media icons which are linked to the corresponding external websites and it cover 100% of the screen width on all screen sizes. Aria label attribute is used for all the external links to communicate the text to screen reader users.
