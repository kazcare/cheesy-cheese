# Cheesy Cheese
Idea of this website to give something special to the community who love cheese alot. So, I decided to make a website with the recipes of some tasty, delicius and famous food made from cheese or used cheese as its main ingredient.
## Features

## Existing Features
### Header/Nav Bar
    Website is having a static header element with logo on the left side of the desktop page and nav bar hanging against it on the left hand side.
    nav bar elements are hilighted by showing a border underneath it when the particular navbar element id hovered, plus the current nav link is highlighted for the current active page.
    These properties and looks of the header and navbar are consistant throughout the website.

### Landing Page
    Home page of the website has a hero image underneath the header and navbar area with cover text on it saying what is the website about.

    Under the hero image, there will be text including some facts about cheese and why people think, it is amazing, what actually cheese is and what is the origin of cheese?
